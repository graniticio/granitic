Package ioc provides an Inversion of Control component container and lifecycle hooks.

This package provides the types that define and support Granitic component container, which allows your application's
objects and Granitic's framework facilities to follow the inversion of control (IoC) pattern by having their lifecycle
and dependencies managed for them. An in-depth discussion of Granitic IoC can be found at https://granitic.io/ref/component-definition-files
but a description of the core concepts follows.

# Components

A component is defined by Granitic as an instance of a Go struct with a name that is unique within an application.
Each component in your application requires a entry in the components section of your application's component definition file like:

	{
	  "components": {
		"componentName": {
		  "type": "package.structType"
		}
	  }
	}

e.g:

	{
	  "components": {
		"createRecordLogic": {
		  "type": "inventory.CreateRecordLogic"
		}
	  }
	}

For complete information on defining components, refer to https://granitic.io/ref/component-container

Granitic's documentation will use the term component and component instance interchangeably. For example, 'component field'
means 'a field on the instance of the Go struct associated with that component'.

# The container

When Granitic starts, it will create an instance of ioc.ComponentContainer - a structure that holds references to
each of the components in your application. It is responsible for injecting dependencies and configuration into your
components (see below) and managing lifecycle events (also see below). The container is also referred to as the component
container or IoC container.

# Framework components

For each Granitic facility that you enable in your application, one or more framework components will be created and added to the container.
A framework component is exactly the same as any other component - an instance of a struct with a name. Depending on the
complexity of the facility, multiple components may be created.

A very simple name-spacing is used to separate the names of framework components from application components -
framework components' names all start with the string grnc

You are strongly encouraged to make sure your application components' names do not start with this string.

# Dependencies and configuration

As part of its definition, your components can request that other components are injected into its fields. Your definition
can also include configuration (actual values to be set when the component is instantiated) or configuration promises
(values to be injected once all sources of configuration have been merged together).

	{
	  "components": {
		"createRecordLogic": {
		  "type": "inventory.CreateRecordLogic",
		  "MaxTracks": 20,
		  "ArtistMustExist": "conf:record.disableAutoArtist",
		  "DAO": "ref:inventoryDAO"
		}
	  }
	}

In the above example, the field CreateRecordLogic.MaxTracks is set to 20 when the struct is instantiated, ArtistMustExist
is set to the config element 'record.disableAutoArtist' and DAO is set to a reference to another component's instance. Note that c: and r:
can be used as shorthand for config: and ref: See https://granitic.io/ref/component-container for more information

Any error such as type mismatches or missing configuration will cause an error that will halt application startup.

# Component templates

A template mechanism exists to allow multiple components that share a type, dependencies or configuration items to
only have those elements defined once. This is especially useful for web service handlers. See
https://granitic.io/ref/component-templates for more details.

# Binding

Unlike JVM/CLR languages, Go has no runtime 'instance-for-type-name' mechanism for creating instances of a struct. As
a result, unlike JVM/CLR IoC containers you may have used, the container does not instantiate the actual instances
of the Go structs behind application components. Instead a 'binding' process is used - refer to the package documentation
for the grnc-bind tool for more information.

# Container lifecycle

The process of starting the container transitions through a number of distinct phase. It is possible for your code
to be explicitly invoked during some of these phases by implementing one more lifecycle interfaces.

	Populate    Application and framework components are stored in the container.

	Configure   Configuration and dependencies are resolved and injected into components.

	Decorate    Components implementing the ioc.ComponentDecorator are given access to all other components
				to potentially modify.

	Start       Components implementing the ioc.Startable interface are invoked.

	Access	    Components implementing ioc.AccessibilityBlocker and ioc.Accessible are interacted with.

	Ready       Granitic application is running.

When the container is ready, a log message similar to

	grncInit Ready (startup time 6.28ms)

will be logged.

There are several other possible lifecycle phases after the container is ready:

	Suspend     Components implementing ioc.Suspendable  have their Suspend method invoked.

	Resume      Components implementing ioc.Suspendable have their Resume method invoked.

	Stop        Components implementing ioc.Stoppable are allowed to stop gracefully before the application exits.

# Decorators

Decorators are special components implementing ioc.ComponentDecorator. Their main purpose is to inject dynamically
created objects into other components (such as Loggers). Decorators are destroyed after the Decorate phase of container
startup.

# Stopping

Components that need to perform some shutdown process before an application exits should implement the Stoppable
interface. See the GoDoc for ioc.Stoppable below for more detail.

# Container settings

The file $GRANITIC_HOME/resource/facility-config/system.json contains configuration, that can be overridden in your
application's configuration file, affecting startup, garbage collection and shutdown behaviour of the container.

More information can be found at https://granitic.io/ref/system-configuration

# Gaining access to the container

If your application component needs direct access to the container it should implement the ioc.ContainerAccessor. A
reference to the container will be injected into your component during the decorate phase.

# External interaction with the container

If your application enables the RuntimeCtl facility, you can interact with the container and its components by using
the grnc-ctl command line utility. See the package documentation for grnc-ctl for more information.
