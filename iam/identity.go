Package iam provides types to develop or integrate with an Identity/Access Management system.

Identity/Access Management (IAM) systems are external components that deal with authenticating (checking credentials) and
authorising (assigning and checking roles and permissions) users and access to a system. There are many third-party IAM
systems available and many developers also choose to implement their own.

As such, Granitic does not attempt to implement an IAM system, but provides types and hooks to integrate existing systems
into the web-service handling workflow.
