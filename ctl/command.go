/*
Package ctl provides functionality for the runtime control of Granitic applications.

If the RuntimeControl facility is enabled for a Granitic application (see https://granitic.io/ref/runtime-control ),
the grnc-ctl command line utility can be used to issue commands to that application via HTTP. Note that the HTTP server
and handlers instantiated to facilitate runtime control are completely separate from the HTTP server that handles user-defined
web services.

Each command is associated with a component hosted in the IoC container that implements the ctl.Command interface described
below. Granitic includes a number of built-in commands for common administration tasks, but users can create their own
commands by implementing the Command interface on any component.
