// It is an opportunity to extract information from the HTTP request to add an ID for this request to the context that
// will be passed to the handler.
//
// # It is the responsibility of the implementor to control the uniqueness of the allocated ID
//
// It is recommended that only the request meta data (headers, path, parameters) are accessed by implementations, as
// loading the request body will interfere with later phases of the request processing.
