/*
Package instance defines functionality for identifying and tuning an individual instance of a Granitic application.

It is anticipated that most Granitic applications will be deployed as part of a group behind a load-balancer or some other
service discovery mechanism. In these circumstances, it is important that each individual instance can be named. So other
services can identify it.

This package defines a type for storing an instance ID and an interface to be implemented
by any component that needs to be aware of the ID of the current instance. An instance ID is specified when starting
Granitic via a command line argument or an InitialSettings struct. See the documentation for the granitic package for
more detail.

This package also defines the data structure for the implicit System facility (which cannot be disabled, but can be configured).
The System facility controls start up and shutdown behaviour as well as some memory management settings. See
https://granitic.io/ref/system-configuration
